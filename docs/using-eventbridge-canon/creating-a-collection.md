If you want to save the Events you publish, you have to store them witin a collection.

###Â What is a collection

Think of the collection as the folder you want to store events. It's just a way to store and manage your events.

To create your new collection click on `My Collections` and `+ Create Collection` in the side bar.

<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;">
    <img width="70%" src="/img/docs/using-eventbridge-canon/create-collection-empty.png">
</div>

Then you will be shown a modal with all your Event bus sources.

<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;">
    <img width="70%" src="/img/docs/using-eventbridge-canon/create-collection-modal.png">
</div>

Selecting a source will show you which events are against that source.

Select an event and create `Create Event`.

This will then take you to the `Event Viewer` where you can edit your event, save it and much more...
