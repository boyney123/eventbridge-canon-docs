If you wish to update the list of `sources` or `events` you will need to run `npm run populate` again.

This command will not remove any data you may have, but will just refresh the data from `AWS`.

> Roadmap: In the future you will be able to update sources and events using the editor, so no need to restart! But for now.... just run npm run populate if you want up to date sources and events.
