I'm a huge fan of [AWS EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) and the ability it can give us to quickly create Event Driven Architectures and help businesses scale and grow.

Like most things, over time you get more and more events you need to manage.

So it's important to understand your event schema and also have the relevant tooling to help you stay productive.

> **EventBridge Canon** was developed to help myself and hopefully others manage and publish events into EventBridge.

I found myself wanting to easily create Events and publish them into EventBridge and reuse previous events I have sent. I stored events locally on my machine, but wanted a tool to help my own productivity.

I wanted to create a solution that gives developers around the world the tools to **save events**, **re-publish** events and **manage events** whilst in development.

    <h6>I believe EventBridge was missing the ability to quickly save and manage events (for local development).</h6>
    <h5 style="margin-top:10px;">EventBridge Canon was built to solve this problem.</h5>
